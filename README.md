# ThermalCycle

Software used as part of PhD project on cyclic oxidation of Nickel based superalloys.
Code runs on Arduino mega microcontroller. A 12V DC motor connected via a 10A DC Motor Driver shield is used alongside a MicroEpsilon WPS-WK30 draw wire displacement sensor for accurate carraige positioning.
